Project Title: E-commerce Customer Analysis Using Azure SQL Server and Power BI

Objective

Analyze customer transaction data to:
•	Identify purchasing patterns
•	Segment customers based on buying behavior
•	Generate revenue insights
•	Visualize findings in Power BI for easy, dynamic reporting

Project Steps

1. Data Collection and Storage (Azure SQL Server)
    •	Database Setup on Azure SQL Server:
        o	Set up an Azure SQL Server instance.
        o	Create a database for storing customer, product, and transaction data.
    •	Define Table Schema:
        o	Customers table: customer_id, name, age, gender, location
        o	Products table: product_id, product_name, category, price
        o	Transactions table: transaction_id, customer_id, product_id, purchase_date, quantity, total_amount
    •	Data Ingestion:
        o	Use SQL INSERT statements to load data manually or use Azure Data Factory (ADF) to automate data ingestion from CSVs or other sources.
        o	Alternatively, bulk upload data directly using Azure SQL's BULK INSERT or the Azure portal.
2. Data Extraction and Preparation (Python)
   •	Database Connection:
        o	Use pyodbc or SQLAlchemy libraries in Python to connect to Azure SQL Server.
    •	Data Cleaning and Preparation:
        o	Use pandas in Python to clean and preprocess the data.
        o	Handle missing values, format dates, and ensure correct data types.
    •	Feature Engineering:
    o	Extract time-based features for analysis, like Year, Month, and Day.

3. Load Data into Power BI
    •	Connect Power BI to Azure SQL Server:
        o	Open Power BI Desktop.
        o	Select Get Data > Azure > Azure SQL Database.
        o	Enter your Azure SQL Server credentials and connect to the database.
        o	Import the Customers, Products, and Transactions tables.
    •	Data Transformation:
        o	Use Power Query within Power BI to perform any additional transformations or data cleaning.
        o	Add calculated columns as needed (e.g., Total Purchase Value as Quantity * Price).

4. Data Analysis and Visualization (Power BI)
  •	Build a Dashboard:
  o	Use Power BI to create dynamic, interactive visualizations based on the data.
Visualization Ideas:
    1.	Revenue Trends Over Time:
      o	Use a Line Chart to display monthly or quarterly revenue trends.
      o	Group data by month and plot total purchase values over time.
    2.	Customer Segmentation:
      o	Use Clustered Bar Charts or Pie Charts to display customer segments based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) scores.
    3.	Top Products and Categories:
      o	Use a Bar Chart to visualize the top products or categories by revenue.
      o	Create filters to enable interactive analysis by category, month, or other dimensions.
    4.	Demographics Insights:
      o	Use Donut Charts or Stacked Bar Charts to analyze demographics like age groups, gender distribution, and geographic location.
    5.	Customer Purchase Behavior:
      o	Use Heat Maps to show purchasing frequency by product or category for each customer segment.
    6.	KPIs and Summary Metrics:
      o	Use Cards or Gauge Charts to show key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, total number of customers, and other KPIs.

5. Publish and Share the Report
    •	Publish to Power BI Service:
      o	Once the report is created, publish it to Power BI Service.
      o	Set up scheduled data refreshes to keep the data up to date. Azure SQL Server supports scheduled refresh in Power BI.
    •	Create Dashboards:
      o	Pin key visualizations to a dashboard for a summary view.
      o	Share the dashboard with stakeholders, giving them real-time access to insights.
    •	Power BI Workspace and Sharing:
      o	Use Power BI Workspace to organize reports and dashboards.
      o	Share with specific team members or groups, and manage access permissions.
